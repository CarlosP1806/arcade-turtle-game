# Python Arcade Style Game

## 📃 Project Description
This is a small side project I built in order to review the concepts of object oriented design in Python. It is similar to Flappy Bird
and uses Pygame as game engine.


## 🤖 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pygame

## 🎯 Learning Objectives 

I was motivated to build this project in order to acquire or strenghten the following developer skills:

- Review Python object-oriented concepts
- Understand how to separate a project into multiple classes that interact with each other

## ⚙️ Functionality

The game is inspired in the original Flappy Bird. The user must press the "space" key in order to move the turtle up and avoid the enemies. 
The main objective is to collect the coins that appear in random locations.

## Credits
The sprites used in the game were obtained under a free license in Craftpix.net. The original content is available at https://craftpix.net/freebies/octopus-jellyfish-shark-and-turtle-free-sprite-pixel-art/?num=1&count=5&sq=turtle&pos=4
